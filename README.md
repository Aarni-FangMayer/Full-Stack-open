# Course Fullstack Open 2025

This repository contains solutions to tasks from the University of Helsinki Full Stack Open 2025 course.

# Structure

Each folder corresponds to a particular block in the course. For example, the "part0" folder refers to the theoretical block of the course "Part 0: Fundamentals of Web apps" and contains files with my version of solving the proposed tasks. 

Each task is placed in a separate file for ease of perception, and is named according to the task number.

# Progress of tasks and repository updates

The repository is updated as the course progresses. Thus, after completing a new theoretical block, solutions to the tasks corresponding to this block will be added.
